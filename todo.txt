BLDM
- Hold pickup adds gun twice
- all players are spawned as red P1 
- Camera doesnt test height

Gun Refactoring
- guns should have a gun state, -> the data should be seperated from the current state and code
- gun ageing should use time rather than 0 to reduce iterations -> just pop top

UI:
1) Character HUD
5) main menu
2) gun cards
3) base shared (map ->, etc)
4) pause menu

Player refactoring:
- use player state rather than player
